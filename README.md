Scientific Question: Are melatonin supplements more effective for those with or without sleep issues, such as delayed sleep phased disorder (DSPD) and low melatonin excretion? 

Null Hypothesis: Melatonin supplements are equally as effective for people with and without issues sleeping, with effectiveness measured by sleep latency.

Alternative hypothesis: Melatonin supplements are more effective for people with sleep issues, with effectiveness measured by sleep latency.

Sleep latency is defined as the length of time that it takes to accomplish the transition from full wakefulness to sleep.
