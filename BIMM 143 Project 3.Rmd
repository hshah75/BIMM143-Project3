Scientific Question: Are melatonin supplements more effective for those with or without sleep issues, such as delayed sleep phased disorder (DSPD) and low melatonin excretion? 

Issues in an individual's circadian rhythm affect one's sleep schedule, and can sometimes be attributed to the "night owl" gene variant, a single-point mutation of the gene CRY1. CRY1 functions as an inhibitor of the circadian clock, and this mutation can cause an individual to stay awake for a half hour or more than usual (Patke 2017). Sleep issues like DSPD, insomnia, and poor sleep quality can also be caused by low levels of melatonin produced in the body (Poza 2018). Research has shown melatonin supplements to be helpful in decreasing sleep latency for certain individuals with sleep issues (Costello 2014). On the other hand, some articles suggest that an excess of melatonin can start to have the opposite affect, and lead to negative side effects (Cleveland Clinic 2019). My research aims to find whether an excess of melatonin could actually turn out to be less effective in regulating one's sleep cycle if an individual already has a normal amount of melatonin and/or no sleep issues. The dependent variables tested in this project will be sleep latency, defined as the length of time that it takes to accomplish the transition from full wakefulness to sleep by Wikipedia.

Scientific Hypothesis:  

Null Hypothesis: Melatonin supplements are equally as effective for people with and without issues sleeping, with effectiveness measured by sleep latency.

Alternative Hypothesis: Melatonin supplements are more effective for people with sleep issues, with effectiveness measured by sleep latency.

Using descriptive statistics provided in several studies on the effects of melatonin on sleep latency in both healthy individuals and those with various sleep issues, random normal distributions were generated. These distributions were then used in hypothesis tests to check whether melatonin had a significant effect on sleep latency.

Below, this bit of code is responsible for loading in all of the necessary packages. Here is where I will define the packages and what they are loaded in for {3 points for adequately describing the packages}:

1) base
2) norm
3) stats
4) graphics

Before running the code below, in the console I needed to install the packages using the commands:

```{r}
install.packages("norm")
# all packages are already installed in R

library(base)
library(norm)
library(stats)
library(graphics)

```

Below, this code creates matrices of the number of individuals, mean, and standard deviation of the dependent variable, sleep latency, for each study included in this project, where every row is a different treatment. 

```{r}
# Study 1: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2933606/ 
# independent variable: treatment (placebo or 2m g dose of melatonin)
# dependent variable: sleep onset latency (abbreviated as sol in matrix)
# patients: individuals who are low excretors of melatonin

low_excretors <- rbind(c(86, 64.2, 66.5, 51.6), c(86, 63.4, 65.1, 59.5))
rownames(low_excretors) <- c("placebo", "melatonin (2 mg)")
colnames(low_excretors) <- c("n", "mean age", "mean sol (min)", "sd of sol (min)")
low_excretors

# Study 2: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02246354.pdf 
# independent variable: treatment (placebo, 0.3 mg dose of melatonin, or 1 mg dose of melatonin)
# dependent variable: sleep onset latency (abbreviated as sol in matrix)
# patients: healthy individuals with no history of sleep issues

healthy_individuals <- rbind(c(12, 53.9, 11.2, 2.2), c(12, 53.9, 7.1, 1.7), c(12, 53.9, 7.6, 2.6))
rownames(healthy_individuals) <- c("placebo", "melatonin (0.3 mg)", "melatoning (1 mg)")
colnames(healthy_individuals) <- c("n", "mean age", "mean sol (min)", "sd of sol (min)")

# independent variable: treatment(placebo or 5 mg dose of melatonin)
# dependent variable: sleep onset latency (abbreviated as sol in matrix)
# patients: individuals with diagnosed delayed sleep phase syndrome

dsps <- rbind(c(8, 37, 209.4, 65.4), c(8, 37, 127.2, 60))

The first study measured the sleep onset latency of individuals who were low excretors of melatonin, causing sleep issues, after they were subjected to either the treatment of a placebo or 2 milligrams of melatonin, taken daily for 3 weeks.

The second study measured the sleep onset latency of healthy individuals with no history of sleep issues after they were subjected to either the treatment of a placebo, 0.3 milligrams of melatonin, or 1 milligram of melatonin on three different days, each separated by 7-10 days.  

The third study measured the sleep onset latency of individuals diagnosed with delayed sleep phase disorder after they were subjected to either the treatment of a placebo or 5 milligrams of melatoning, taken daily for 4 weeks.

In this next line of code, I will be using rnorm() to simulate normal distributions using the mean, standard deviations, and number of individuals given for each of the treatments in every study because the individual data points for sleep latency were not given. Althought the rnorm() is not always perfectly exact, it gives a relatively accurate distribution with the arguments inputted. 

```{r}
# Study 1

placebo_1 <- rnorm(n = low_excretors[1, 1], mean = low_excretors[1, 3], sd = low_excretors[1, 4])
mel_2mg <- rnorm(n = low_excretors[2, 1], mean = low_excretors[2, 3], sd = low_excretors[2, 4])

# Study 2

placebo_2 <- rnorm(n = healthy_individuals[1, 1], mean = healthy_individuals[1, 3], sd = healthy_individuals[1, 4])
mel_0.3mg <- rnorm(n = healthy_individuals[2, 1], mean = healthy_individuals[2, 3], sd = healthy_individuals[2, 4])
mel_1mg <- rnorm(n = healthy_individuals[3, 1], mean = healthy_individuals[3, 3], sd = healthy_individuals[3, 4])

# Study 3 

placebo_3 <- rnorm(n = dsps[1, 1], mean = dsps[1, 3], sd = dsps[1, 4])
mel_5mg <- rnorm(n = dsps[2, 1], mean = dsps[2, 3], sd = dsps[2, 4])
```

I will now be using t.test() to perform one-sided two-sample hypothesis tests on each study. A hypothesis test will compare the sleep latency distributions for the placebo and melatonin treatment groups and determine if the sleep latency of the melatonin group is significantly less than that of the placebo group. This would mean that individuals would fall asleep faster. The data will be deemed statistically significant if the p-value is less than the alpha, or significance, level of 0.05, meaning that the data would be unlikely to be observed, given that the null hypothesis of the sleep latency being the same both treatment groups was assumed to be true. 


Below is the code for running the hypothesis test on the data from Study 1. 
```{r}
# Study 1 
# alternative is set to "g" to signify that the alternative hypothesis is testing whether the true difference in means (placebo - melatonin) is greater than 0, meaning that melatonin group has a significantly lower sleep latency
# var.equal is set to FALSE to indicate the differences in variance of the treatment group distributions

# Perform hypothesis test with placebo_1 and mel_2mg group
t.test(placebo_1, mel_2mg, alternative = "g", var.equal=FALSE)

```

The resulting p-value from the Welch Two Sample t-test was p = 0.9812. At an alpha level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the mean sleep latency of individuals given the placebo and the individuals given 2 milligrams of melatonin was equal, given that the individuals were naturally low excretors of melatonin, because p > 0.05. 


Below is the code for running the hypothesis test on the data from Study 2. 
```{r}
# Study 2 
# alternative is set to "g" to signify that the alternative hypothesis is testing whether the true difference in means (placebo - melatonin) is greater than 0, meaning that melatonin group has a significantly lower sleep latency
# var.equal is set to FALSE to indicate the differences in variance of the treatment group distributions

# Perform hypothesis test with placebo_2 and mel_0.3mg group
t.test(placebo_2, mel_0.3mg, alternative = "g", var.equal=FALSE) 

# Perform hypothesis test with placebo_2 and mel_1mg group
t.test(placebo_2, mel_1mg, alternative = "g", var.equal=FALSE)
```

The resulting p-value from the first Welch Two Sample t-test conducted with the treatements of placebo and a 0.3 mg dose of melatonin was p = 0.003659. At an alpha level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that the mean sleep latency of individuals given the placebo and the individuals given 0.3 milligrams of melatonin was equal, given that the individuals were healthy with no history of sleep issues, because p < 0.05.

The resulting p-value from the second Welch Two Sample t-test conducted with the treatements of placebo and a 1 mg dose of melatonin was p = 0.02244. At an alpha level of 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis that the mean sleep latency of individuals given the placebo and the individuals given 1 milligram of melatonin was equal, given that the individuals were healthy with no history of sleep issues, because p < 0.05.


Below is the code for running the hypothesis test on the data from Study 3. 
```{r}
# Study 3 
# alternative is set to "g" to signify that the alternative hypothesis is testing whether the true difference in means (placebo - melatonin) is greater than 0, meaning that melatonin group has a significantly lower sleep latency
# var.equal is set to FALSE to indicate the differences in variance of the treatment group distributions

# Perform hypothesis test with placebo_3 and mel_5mg group
t.test(placebo_3, mel_5mg, alternative = "g", var.equal=FALSE)

```

The resulting p-value from the Welch Two Sample t-test was p = 0.11. At an alpha level of 0.01, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the mean sleep latency of individuals given the placebo and the individuals given 5 milligrams of melatonin was equal, given that the individuals were diagnosed with DSPS, because p > 0.05. 


The three chunks below are the code to create boxplots to visualize the differences in the distributions for each of treatments for each study.
```{r}

# Study 1
# Create side by side boxplots using random normal distributions generated for placebo_1 and mel_2mg
boxplot(placebo_1, mel_2mg, names = c('placebo', 'melatonin (2 mg)'), ylab = "mean sleep onset latency (minutes)")

```
The boxplots above overlap almost entirely, with the median sleep latency of individuals in the the melatonin (2 mg) group actually being slightly higher than that of individuals in the placebo group. The variance around the median also looks to be approximately equal. This is consistent with the results of the hypothesis test, because we failed to reject the null hypothesis that the mean sleep latency of individuals given the placebo and the individuals given 2 milligrams of melatonin was equal for the individuals that were naturally low excretors of melatonin.


```{r}

# Study 2
# Create side by side boxplots using random normal distributions generated for placebo_2, mel_0.3mg, and mel_1mg
boxplot(placebo_2, mel_0.3mg, mel_1mg, names = c('placebo', 'melatonin (0.3 mg)', 'melatonin (1 mg)'), ylab = 'mean sleep onset latency (minutes)')

```
The boxplots above look distinctly different from each other, with the data points in melatonin (0.3 mg) group being clustered closer together than those of the placebo group. The data points in the melatonin (1 mg) group have even less variation around the median. Both the medians of the melatonin treatment groups are lower than that of the placebo group and the visual difference in the boxplots is consisent with the hypothesis test, because we rejected the null hypothesis that the mean sleep latency of individuals given the placebo and the individuals given 0.3 milligrams of melatonin or 1 milligram of melatonin was equal for the individuals that were healthy with no history of sleep issues.


```{r}

# Study 3
# Create side by side boxplots using random normal distributions generated for placebo_3 and mel_5mg
boxplot(placebo_3, mel_5mg, names = c('placebo', 'melatonin (5 mg)'), ylab = 'mean sleep onset latency (minutes)')

```
The boxplots of the data points from the placebo and melatonin (5 mg) groups mostly overlap, with the boxplot for the melatonin (5 mg) group being almost entirely encompassed in the boxplot for the placebo distribution because it has just a slightly lower median and variance. This is consistent with the hypothesis test, because we failed to reject the null hypothesis that the mean sleep latency of individuals given the placebo and the individuals given 5 milligrams of melatonin was equal, given that the individuals were diagnosed with DSPS.


Analysis of Results: The only study where the results were significant was Study 2, which was conducted on healthy individuals with no history of sleep issues. Those healthy individuals tested had a statistically significant decrease in their sleep latency when given either 0.3 milligrams or 1 milligram of melatoning, compared to being given a placebo, meaning the melatonin was effective in making them fall asleep quicker. The data analyzed from Studies 1 and 3 were not statistically siginificant, meaning that 2 milligrams of melatonin did not significantly decrease sleep latency of individuals who were low excretors of melatonin and 5 milligrams of melatonin did not significantly decrease sleep latency of individuals who were diagnosed with Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder. Upon visual observation with boxplots, these results were once again shown. Although the doses of melatonin, the age of the participants, and the treatment period varied, my alternative hypothesis that melatonin supplements are more effective for people with sleep issues, with effectiveness measured by sleep latency, was shown to not be true in the data from these studies.
